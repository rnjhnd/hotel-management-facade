# Simplified Hotel Management System

<div align="justify">The HotelApp needs to manage various hotel services for guest check-in and check-out. These services include valet parking for vehicles, room cleaning, and handling luggage carts. However, the HotelApp aims to interact with these services through a simplified, single interface provided by the FrontDesk. The FrontDesk class should delegate the client's requests to the appropriate service classes (Valet, HouseKeeping, Cart) while abstracting the service details from the client.

### **Class Definitions:**

**HotelService (Interface):** Defines the common interface for all hotel services.

**Valet:** A service class implementing the HotelService interface, responsible for vehicle valet parking and pick-up. It includes the `pickUpVehicle(plateNumber)` method.

HouseKeeping: A service class implementing the HotelService interface, responsible for room cleaning. It includes the `cleanRoom(roomNumber)` method.

**Cart:** A service class implementing the HotelService interface, responsible for handling luggage cart requests. It includes the `requestCart(numberOfCarts)` method.

**FrontDesk:** The facade class that coordinates interactions between the client `(HotelApp)` and the individual hotel services.

**HotelApp:** The client class that uses the FrontDesk facade to access and utilize hotel services seamlessly.
